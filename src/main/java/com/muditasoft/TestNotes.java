    /**
     *      What is a 'good' or 'bad' test?
     * Red => Green => Refactor
     * 1- A new test will initially fail
     * 2- We work to get the test to pass
     * 3- We finally optimise our code, and tests
     *
     *      Rules of testing
     * - Test one item of functionality only
     * - Test business logic, not methods
     * - Tests must be repeatable, and consistent (LocalDate.now -> LocalDate.of(2019, 1, 1))
     * - Tests must be thorough
     *
     *      What tests should i write?
     * - What should the logic be?
     * - What is the opposite to that logic?
     * - Are there any edge cases?
     * - Are there any error conditions?
     *
